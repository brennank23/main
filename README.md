# Random Generator
This is a tool that utilizes the random library and random shuffle function from the Python language.  
The user can run the shell script, where they have a menu giving them several options for chance.  
This could be useful when you need to flip a coin and don't have one (one option). 
When you need a fair random selection of a number (or numbers) in a give range (another option). 
Or when you need a list of items randomly shuffled (the third option).
